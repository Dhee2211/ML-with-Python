## Simple Linear Regression
In linear regression we have some x values and some y values, and the problem is to find the best fit line for the graph of x and y.

In simple word we have to find `y = mx + c` line. From an array of `Xs` and an array of `ys`. To find the line we have to find the slope `m` and the y-intercept `c`.

The way to find `m` is:

And the way to find c is:
